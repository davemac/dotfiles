#
# Upload Sync Functions:
# ‚Ä¢ getups [alias] [options]   - Sync WordPress uploads directory from remote to local
#   - getups l                 : Sync from production (live)
#   - getups s                 : Sync from staging
#   - getups l -latest         : Sync only recent uploads (last 2 months)
#   Options:
#   - -latest                  : Only sync files modified in last 60 days
#   - --dry-run               : Preview what would be synced without transferring
#
# ‚Ä¢ pushups [options]          - Push local uploads to remote server
#   Options:
#   - -auto                   : Auto-detect site and SSH alias
#   - -target [staging|production] : Specify deployment target
#   - --dry-run               : Preview what would be pushed without transferring
#
# ‚Ä¢ getrecentuploads [alias]   - Sync only recently modified uploads (last 60 days)
#
# Features:
# ‚Ä¢ Automatic SSH connectivity validation before sync
# ‚Ä¢ Progress bars and transfer statistics  
# ‚Ä¢ Configurable exclusion patterns via UPLOAD_EXCLUDES config
# ‚Ä¢ Directory structure preservation
# ‚Ä¢ Resume capability for interrupted transfers
# ‚Ä¢ Comprehensive error handling and logging
# ‚Ä¢ Help flags (--help, -h) for detailed usage information
#
# Configuration:
# ‚Ä¢ Uses UPLOAD_EXCLUDES from .dotfiles-config for file exclusion patterns
# ‚Ä¢ Supports SSH timeout configuration via SSH_TIMEOUT
# ‚Ä¢ Auto-detects WordPress root and uploads directory structure
#
# ============================================================================

# Download uploads from a specified environment (staging or live) for the current site.
#
# This function must be executed from within a site's subdirectory under '~/Sites'.
# It downloads uploads from the specified environment (staging or live) using an SSH alias.
# If the '-latest' option is provided, only the uploads from the current and previous months are downloaded.
#
# Usage:
#   getups s           # Download all uploads from staging
#   getups l           # Download all uploads from live
#   getups s -latest   # Download only last 2 months from staging
#   getups l -latest   # Download only last 2 months from live
# Arguments:
#   $1 - Environment specifier ('s' for staging, 'l' for live).
#   $2 - Optional '-latest' flag to download only the last 2 months of uploads.
#
# Returns:
#   1 - If an error occurs (e.g., directory not found, missing arguments, SSH alias not found).
#   0 - On successful completion.
#
# Errors:
#   Displays error messages for various failure conditions such as incorrect directory,
#   missing arguments, or SSH connection issues.
